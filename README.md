# Keylogger
This KeyLogger was created in C and is intended to simulate the dangers of a KeyLogger so I have a better understanding of what to look for when I encounter them in the CyberSecurity Field.
The basic idea is that once compiled and ran it hides in the background and keeps track of each key pressed and returns each individual key press to a txt file
that I named System33. I wanted to also not make something that was unrealistic i.e a file named keylogger that logs keys. For real use most likley the name would be something much less obvious,
I only kept this name for demonstration purposes and clarity. Some parts of this code use techniques such as Code Obfuscation and Steganography. I will explain how I used these terms.

1. Code Obfuscation
    This technique invloved changing variable names to be more obscure, adding junk code, and adding random functions that never run but appear to.
    These are all ways it can be much more difficult for someone to detect Mal intent. Below are some example in my code

2. Steganography


# Things to LookOut for
1. High CPU Usage
